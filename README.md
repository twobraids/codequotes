I like the way that github highlights python code. In my own blogs and presentations,
I want to highlight code in the same manner. Each commit in this repo represents a single
code quote. This repo gives both a linkable history and a source for mining HTML for code
quotes inserted into wikis, blogs and presentations. I like the consistency and flexibility
of github's CSS tagging in code quotes.


```yaml
automation:
  alias: Turn on the porch light an hour after the sun sets
  initial_state: true
  hide_entity: false
  trigger:
    platform: sun
    event: sunset
    offset: "01:00:00"  
  action:
    service: porchlight.turn_on

```

```python
    weather_station = WeatherStation(config)

    server = config.server.wot_server_class(
        config,
        [weather_station],
        port=config.server.service_port
    )
    server.run()
                
```
